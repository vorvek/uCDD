# Beta 0.9.1b

This update improves CD access and loading speed in protected-mode DOS games.

## Changes in 0.9.1b

- Support stack arguments in DPMI real-mode interrupt and far-call services. This fixes CD-ROM initialization errors in Pro Pinball: The Web and Timeshock.
- Accept short, non-interleaved CD read requests. This fixes the CD prompts in Screamer, Screamer 2, and Screamer Rally.
- Reuse extended-memory pages and reduce page-table updates, memory clearing, and interrupt-stepping overhead to improve loading speed with resident audio.
- Correct the distinction between a protection fault and physical IRQ 5 under EMM386. This prevents the Screamer reset when CD audio starts with that interrupt configuration.
- Add an optional host-profiling build without adding counters to the normal release build.

# Beta 0.9.1a

This update corrects interrupt timing in the internal protected-mode host. It retains the audio changes from Beta 0.9.1.

## Changes in 0.9.1a

- Honor the one-instruction interrupt delay after `STI`. Preserve this state across callbacks and defer pending hardware and sound interrupts until delivery is permitted.
- Allocate a separate entry stack for the standalone development host, and free it when the host exits. This avoids the layout-sensitive stack failures seen while testing the larger host.
- Document Microsoft EMM386's shared-DMA limitation and the JEMMEX or separate-channel alternatives. This release does not attempt to recover physical DMA programming after a game overwrites it.


# Beta 0.9.1

This beta fixes CD access and mixed-audio problems in protected-mode DOS games. CD music and game PCM still use the same physical Sound Blaster output.

## Changes

- Correct interrupt delivery during protected-mode disk calls and real-mode callbacks. This fixes the reproduced Tomb Raider startup stall after the DOS/4GW banner.
- Run background CD reads after the protected interrupt handler returns. This fixes Tomb Raider effects that played a short beginning and then restarted while CD music was active.
- Keep hardware interrupt requests pending when all four interrupt stacks are in use. This prevents the reproduced interrupt-stack exhaustion abort without adding more stacks.
- Correct interrupt stepping, mixed-width return frames, and nested stack ownership. Process supported REP copy/fill instructions in bounded batches.
- Preserve the physical audio interrupt route when games change their virtual PIC mask. Keep real-mode port traps active during protected-mode calls and route sound interrupts to the handler that owns them.
- Correct the PCM consumption clock, pause behavior, non-power-of-two DMA rings, and single-cycle 16-bit transfers. A small tail cache preserves samples while a game refills its ring buffer.
- Support the reset-port read and short stereo transfer used by Archimedean Dynasty during sound detection.
- Recover CD playback after a queue underrun and increase the refill budget. Failed XMS operations still stop playback.
- Correct callback-slot reuse and host cleanup ordering.
- Support the changed port-trap callback interface tested with JEMMEX 5.87pre1, as well as 5.86.
